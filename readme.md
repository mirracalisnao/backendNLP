# If you want to include Machine Learning techniques, please create a separate file, and then call it on the main.py file

Note when running flask app:
    1. Make sure to take note of the URL given if you are planning to create a separate codebase for your frontend, 
    ![alt text](image.png)

    You will use this as your endpoint.

    2. This URL will depend on the device's IPv4 address, and by default it is set to dynamic.
